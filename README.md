# Dine N Dash

A Flutter application.

## Introduction

We intend to create a seamless and time efficient Point-of-Sale system that will create a better experience for both restaurants and their guest. Dine n’ Dash will be available own both iOS and Android devices. The sole purpose of the application is to allow our users with the capabilities to check into restaurants, view and order from their menu, check live status updates, and checkout via the mobile application. Meanwhile the same will apply for the restaurant's end by allowing the servers to submit and take orders through the application and transfer it over to the kitchen seamlessly. Our goal is to make everyone's life easier by keeping them on the same page, and that’s the reason why we decided to build an application to cater towards improving IOT within the food industry.
